                <p class="content">
                New York City, one of the most populous urban centers in the world, is home to a diverse and bustling population. With so many people constantly on the move—commuting to work, school, —the availability of food sources is essential. My goal is to explore the spatial distribution of grocery stores and delis across the city, analyzing how their locations correlate with socioeconomic factors like poverty and income at the census tract level. Specifically, I aim to identify food deserts by examining the interplay between poverty rates, median income, and the availability of grocery stores. This project will assess the quality of food resources based on the presence and density of delis and grocery stores. While fast food restaurants are a popular choice for many, delis provide a more affordable and often quicker alternative, offering freshly made meals at lower prices than major fast-food chains. Grocery stores serve as the backbone of food access, supplying residents with everything they need for their weekly meals.

                <p class="content">
                    In New York City, food deserts are concentrated in specific neighborhoods, often in lower-income areas where residents face limited access to healthy food options. This is a result of various factors including transportation barriers, high food prices, and the absence of grocery stores and fresh produce markets.

                <p class="content">
                    Several factors contribute to the creation and persistence of food deserts in NYC. These include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Income Inequality:</strong> Low-income communities have fewer options for accessing nutritious foods.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transportation Issues:</strong> Limited access to public transportation makes it harder for people to reach grocery stores or farmers' markets.</li>
                        <li><strong>Urban Planning:</strong> Many neighborhoods lack zoning that supports the development of grocery stores in underserved areas.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p class="content">
Initially, scatterplots were run to observe the relationship between grocery store density with median income and poverty rate. While the correlations were not particularly strong, the data suggested a trend where store density tended to decrease as median income increased in census tracts. The box plot with quintiles better illustrates this pattern.                </p>

                <p class="content">
                    Given that the relationship between grocery store density and median income is not constant and the scatterplot did not show a linear pattern, I chose a Geographically Weighted Regression to better capture how these two factors interact across different census tracts. My goal was to uncover localized patterns and identify specific areas that might be lacking in grocery store access. The coefficient shown below is for median income, and it is higher in parts of East New York and Northern Queens, suggesting a stronger positive relationship between income and store density in these areas. The greatest variation is observed in Staten Island, where the relationship between income and store density shifts notably going north to south.

                <p class="content">
                    While there appears to be no strong correlation between income and the distribution of grocery stores across the city, there may be a different pattern between big-name chain stores and locally owned stores. National grocery chains might follow different market trends and business strategies compared to independent, neighborhood-based stores, which could reveal new insights into food access across various socioeconomic groups. For instance, chain stores may be more likely to be located in wealthier, high-traffic areas, while locally owned stores may cater more to lower-income or underserved communities, though potentially with different types of offerings.
                <p class="content">
                Building on this, I initially intended to explore the role of delis and community-based organizations in food access, but they were not included in this analysis due to time constraints. Moving forward, the next step could involve examining the relationship between grocery store distribution and poverty rate, followed by analyzing the spatial patterns of delis and their correlation with demographic variables like income and poverty. By running Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) on delis, I aim to identify specific areas of NYC where the presence of delis and grocery stores is most strongly correlated with poverty and income levels. From there, I would rate these areas in terms of their healthy food access, providing a clearer picture of where healthy food options are most needed.
